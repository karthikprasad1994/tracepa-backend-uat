        "ltD_Decription": "In conjunction with the annual audit, we will also perform reviews of the Company`s unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the three quarters in the years ending January 31, 2025. For these, we will perform reviews of that information before the Form 10-Q is filed. The objective of a review is to provide a basis for communicating whether there are any material modifications that should be made to the interim financial information for it to conform to GAAP.\r\n\r\nThese reviews will be conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of performing analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It includes obtaining sufficient knowledge of the Company`s business and its internal control as it relates to the preparation of both annual and interim financial information to identify the types of potential material misstatements in the interim financial information and consider the likelihood of their occurrence, and to select the inquiries and analytical procedures that will provide a basis for communicating whether there are material modifications that should be made to the interim financial information for it to conform with GAAP. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance PCAOB standards, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we will not express opinions on the interim financial information.\r\n\r\nManagement is responsible for the Company`s interim financial information and for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. It is also responsible for identifying and ensuring that the Company complies with the laws and regulations applicable to its activities: making all financial records and related information available to us: adjusting the interim financial information to correct material misstatements: and affirming that the effects of any uncorrected misstatements pertaining to the periods under review are immaterial, both individually and in the aggregate, to the interim financial information taken as a whole.\r\n\r\nWe will communicate to the audit committee and management any matters that come to our attention as a result of the reviews that we believe may require material modifications to the quarterly financial information to make it conform with GAAP. We will also communicate any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that come to our attention. If, for any reason, we are unable to complete our reviews or are unable to obtain or have not obtained limited assurance on the interim financial information, we may decline to issue reports as a result of our engagements, and we will notify the audit committee and management. At the conclusion of our reviews, you agree to provide certain representations from management about the financial statements and related matters.\r\n\r\nWe are required to read any document, including the annual report to shareholders and filings with the SEC, that contains or incorporates by reference our audit or interim review reports, or contains any reference to us. We will read the annual report for the purpose of determining whether other information in the annual report (including the manner of its presentation) is materially inconsistent with information in the financial statements or management`s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company`s internal control over financial reporting. We assume no obligation to perform procedures to corroborate such other information as part of our audit.\r\n\r\nRegarding electronic filings, management agrees that, before filing any document in electronic format with the SEC with which we are associated, we will be advised of the proposed filing on a timely basis. We will provide the Company a signed copy of our report and consent. These manually signed documents will serve to authorize the use of our name prior to the Company`s electronic transmission. Management will provide us with a complete copy of the accepted document.",

The costs of any mediation proceeding shall be shared equally by all parties. Any issue concerning the extent to which any dispute is subject to arbitration, or any dispute concerning the applicability, interpretation, or enforceability of these dispute resolution procedures, including any contention that all or part of these procedures is invalid or unenforceable, shall be governed by and resolved by the arbitrators. By operation of this provision, the parties agree to forego litigation over such disputes in any court of competent jurisdiction. Mediation, if selected, may take place at a location to be designated by the parties and shall take place in Bangalore, India. Damages that are inconsistent with any applicable agreement between the parties or that are not measured by the prevailing party’s actual damages shall be unavailable in arbitration or any other forum. For the sake of clarity, the preceding sentence is not intended to prohibit any claim for punitive damages. In no event, even if any other portion of these provisions is held to be invalid or unenforceable, shall the arbitration panel have power to make an award or impose a remedy that could not be made or imposed by a court deciding the matter in the same jurisdiction. Either party may seek to enforce any written agreement reached by the parties during mediation, or to confirm and enforce any final award entered in arbitration, in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the agreement to such procedures, either party may seek equitable relief to enforce its rights in any court of competent jurisdiction.",
